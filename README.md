This is a repository that stores data related to the manuscript, "Classroom interactions facilitate a sense of belonging in remote STEM classes: Lessons from a large-scale quantitative study". Here, we have posted the figures in the paper that would be generated for different threshold values for the number of classes with statistically significant difference in medians for a question to be included in the analysis. This threshold variable (th_qn) is whole number. Each folder in this repository are the results for a different value of th_qn, indicated by the folder name which has the format "th_qn<value>" where <value> is the value of th_qn.
